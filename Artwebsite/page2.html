    <h2>What is Painting?</h2>
    <p>Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface. The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used. <img src="https://www.painterartist.com/static/ptr/product_content/painter/2018/bob-ross/gallery/03.jpg"> </p>

    <h2>Renaissance Art</h2>

    <p>The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. The origins of Renaissance art can be traced to Italy in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. During this so-called “proto-Renaissance” period (1280-1400), Italian scholars and artists saw themselves as reawakening to the ideals and achievements of classical Roman culture. Writers such as Petrarch (1304-1374) and Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375) looked back to ancient Greece and Rome and sought to revive the languages, values and intellectual traditions of those cultures after the long period of stagnation that had followed the fall of the Roman Empire in the sixth century. <img src="https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/db13732cd515d94307f7a8cae2c650f0fb2eb517.jpg"></p>

    <h2>Modern Art</h2>
    <p>Modern art includes artistic work produced during the period extending roughly from the 1860s to the 1970s, and denotes the styles and philosophy of the art produced during that era. The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation.<img src="https://st.hzcdn.com/simgs/98818f43066b27e4_4-4349/modern-paintings.jpg"> </p>
