    <h2>What is the point of coloring a picture?</h2>
    <p>
    <br>

Some may think to theirselves,"Why do we color our pictures?", well many children receive their first exposure to the color wheel and art, through the use of crayons, markers, and colored pencils.  Learning how to tell the difference between red, pink, green, yellow, and so forth, might not seem like a big deal, but children who color with crayons or markers early on, have an easier time of understanding colors, the makeup of colors, and the mixing of colors.  This can only help the child as he/she gets older, and is exposed to the full spectrum of color in the color wheel.

<br>
<br>
 When coloring on a blank "canvas", is a way for children and adults alike to express themselves.  You can tell a lot about the way a person is feeling by the images that they draw, the colors that they use, etc.  A child who draws skulls and other disturbing objects might be crying out for help, in the only way that he/she knows how.  A child who draws hearts, suns, and other cheerful objects may be expressing satisfaction, content, and love, in the only way that he/she knows how.  It is important to give children a chance to express themselves, and not all children express themselves through words and through writing, many use art.<img src="http://www.xrite.com/-/media/xrite/images/whitepaper/color-communication-guide/whitepaper-color-communication-guide-large.jpg?h=400&w=800&la=en&hash=9B304E79568D6D57EAE98CB0D1DD0B2CBA05CF30"></p>
