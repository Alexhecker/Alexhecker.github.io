    <h2>What is Art?</h2>
    <p>Everyone thinks of art in a different way, I think of art as an imitation of nature, but in the 19th century, photography took over that function, and in the 20th, abstract art overturned the whole notion that art was about representation. And although art meant skill early on, conceptual artists elevated ideas over execution. So what is art? Does it have to be beautiful? Expressive? Original? Uplifting? Or intellectual?<img src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAkjAAAAJDEyZDYxZjgxLTQxY2MtNGY2Yy1hNmI4LThjMGI4OTkyMjQ0ZQ.jpg"></p>
    <p>Art is something we do, a verb. Art is an expression of our thoughts, emotions, intuitions, and desires, but it is even more personal than that: itâ€™s about sharing the way we experience the world, which for many is an extension of personality. It is the communication of intimate concepts that cannot be faithfully portrayed by words alone. And because words alone are not enough, we must find some other vehicle to carry our intent. But the content that we instill on or in our chosen media is not in itself the art. Art is to be found in how the media is used, the way in which the content is expressed.</p>

    <h2>Why do people enjoy art?</h2>
    <p>People feel emotions and ask questions. They enjoy certain emotions and lines of thinking more than others. The art or music evokes a blend of thoughts and emotions that can be similar to a fine restaurant dish, or even just basic-but-appealing junk food. To see or hear art that you connect with means there are others like you in the world. We all thrive on a feeling of belonging to a group, especially if it includes a sophisticated (or just some other quality we appreciate) artist in its ranks.<img src=""></p>
